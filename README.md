# Phishing-Websites-Detection

## Introduction

Phishing websites are the websites that are designed to look like a legitimate
website to steal the user's sensitive information such as username, password,
credit card details, etc. Phishing websites are one of the most common cyber
threats that are faced by the users.

The main aim of this project is to detect the phishing websites using machine
learning algorithms.

The dataset used in this project is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains 11055 URLs and 32 features. The features are extracted from
the URLs and are used to detect the phishing websites. The dataset is
imbalanced and contains 6157 phishing websites and 4898 legitimate websites.
The dataset is preprocessed and the machine learning models are trained on
the preprocessed dataset. The trained models are evaluated using various
performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.
The best model is selected based on the performance metrics and is used to
detect the phishing websites.
